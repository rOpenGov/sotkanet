# sotkanet 0.10.1 (2024-07-10)

### NEW FEATURES
* New functions: `sotkanet_cite()` for citing datasets (issue #16, PR #17 by @Allaht2) and `sotkanet_interactive()` for interactively downloading datasets (issue #20, PR #21 by @Allaht2).
* New dependencies / imports: move from using `httr` package to `httr2` package (issue #19, PR #24 by @Allaht2). Other new imports are `lubridate`, `RefManageR`, `digest`, `frictionless` and `magrittr`.
* Added new versions for functions `GetDataSotkanet`, `SotkanetRegions`, `SotkanetIndicators` and `SotkanetIndicatorMetadata`. The new version are called `get_sotkanet`, `sotkanet_regions`, `sotkanet_indicators` and `sotkanet_indicator_metadata`. The old versions of different functions are kept without deprecation messages or warnings, but users are gently encouraged to use the new functions (issue #18, PR #25 by @Allaht2)
* Functions `get_sotkanet`, `sotkanet_regions`, `sotkanet_indicators` and `sotkanet_indicator_metadata` have support for caching (issue #14, PR #21 by @Allaht2). They also now support English and Swedish in addition to Finnish (issue #9, PR #21 by @Allaht2).
*`get_sotkanet` can return a frictionless datapackage with metadata added in (issue #15, PR #21 by @Allaht2). 

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT
* Remove dependencies / imports: `httr` and `jsonlite`
* Removed function `try_GET`

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Updated vignette and README to use new versions of the functions. Old vignette is retained.
* Added Finnish version of the vignette as an article (issue #10, PR #24 by @Allaht2).
* Moved from using `PascalCase` naming convention to using `snake_case` for new functions (issue #18). 
* Function `get_sotkanet()` has default `years` value of `NULL` that gives the data from all the available years for the dataset (issue #12, PR #24 by @Allaht2).
* The default value for `genders` is now `c("male", "female", "total")` (issue #22, PR #24 by @Allaht2).
* New `region.category` supported by the API, `YTA` ("yhteisty√∂alue") now mentioned in relevant function documentation (PR #26 by @Allaht2)

# sotkanet 0.9.79 (2022-02-01)

### NEW FEATURES
 * Functions pointing to external resources (`sotkanet.json_query()` and `sotkanet.csv_query()`) should now fail gracefully. New internal functions are in R/http_funs.R
 * New dependencies / imports: httr package for handling URLs and error messages and curl package for internet connection testing. jsonlite for handling data from json files
 * Http functions now include information on user agent. The default is "rOpenGov/sotkanet" to help API providers track package usage but it can be changed in relevant functions: `GetDataSotkanet()`, `SotkanetIndicators()` and `SotkanetRegions()`.
 
### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

 * Removed internal functions: `GetDataSotkanetSingleIndicator` and `SotkanetData`.
 * Removed dependency / import: rjson
 * Deleted unused function: `base_url`
 
### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

 * Functionalities from GetDataSotkanetSingleIndicator and SotkanetData are now embedded in one function, `GetDataSotkanet()`.
 * Some files in ./R/ folder have been renamed for better legibility: internal.R to SotkanetCollect.R and sotkanet.R to SotkanetRegions.R
 * New alias for downloading indicator metadata: `SotkanetIndicatorMetadata()` (usesSotkanetIndicator(id))
 * To help save bandwidth, when provided with a predefined list of indicators, `SotkanetIndicators()` now downloads metadata individually instead of fetching and subsetting the whole indicator dataset.
 * Vignette will no longer fetch external resources on CRAN.
 * Package license clarified: BSD 2-clause instead of FreeBSD
